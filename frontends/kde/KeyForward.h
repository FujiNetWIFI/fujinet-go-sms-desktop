 * Qt key events to X11/xkb keysyms.

 * The session's bindings are keyed by the PHYSICAL key -- the unshifted

 * what a key means, and so that Qt's already-shifted key() cannot change
 * which binding a key hits. The route is the hardware scan code (evdev on
 * Linux) through the session's HID table, with a Qt::Key fallback for
 * anything the table has no usage for.
