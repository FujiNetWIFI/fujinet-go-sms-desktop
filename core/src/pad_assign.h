/*
 * pad_assign -- the remembered pad -> port assignments, as a pure table with
 * a text form for the settings key "pad_assign". No SDL and no session: the
 * gamepad layer passes the SDL GUID as its 32-character hex string.
 *
 * Text form: entries separated by ';', each
 *     <guid>|<percent-encoded name>=<port>
 * The name escapes ';' '|' '=' '%' and control characters (below 0x20, 0x7F)
 * as %XX, so an entry never holds a separator and the settings file stays one
 * line. The table is ordered oldest first and holds at most
 * SMS_PAD_ASSIGN_MAX entries: the oldest is dropped to make room.
 *
 * A device is its GUID plus its name. find() matches the GUID first (the
 * newest entry with that GUID) and falls back to the name alone (some
 * systems give the same pad another GUID in another USB port). Two identical
 * pads (same GUID and name) cannot be told apart: they share one entry, and
 * the gamepad layer applies it to the first one that connects.
