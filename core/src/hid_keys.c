/*
 * hid_keys -- native key code <-> USB HID Keyboard usage translation, and
 * the names for those usages.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: smssession.h's curated SMSSESSION_KEYSYM_* symbols name
 * only the keys the *default* controller and ECS keyboard maps care about --
 * a couple of dozen out of the ~120 a USB keyboard can report. Everything
 * else used to translate to keysym 0, which a keypad window's Map mode reads
 * as "not a key" and silently discards. That made a console-to-USB
 * adapter unmappable: the Ultimate PC Interface's ECS-keyboard and
 * Music-Synthesizer personalities are HID keyboards emitting usages a normal
 * PC keyboard has no cap for, so the keys the user most needed to bind were
 * exactly the ones that could not be captured.
 *
 * The HID Keyboard usage page is the right common currency for the fallback
 * band: it is what the device actually puts on the wire, and every host key
 * numbering below is a permutation of it, so one shared name table serves all
 * four frontends and a persisted binding means the same thing in each.
 *
 * ALL THREE TABLES COMPILE EVERYWHERE, on purpose. The maintainer has no
 * Windows machine (cmake/toolchains/mingw-w64.cmake's own header says so),
 * and the bug this file fixes was a Windows-only translation gap that no
 * Linux test could see. Keeping the tables host-independent lets
 * core/tests/hid_keys_test.c check the Windows and macOS ones from Linux CI.
