/*
 * smshelp -- the app's Help: data/help/help.md, built in by
 * tools/help/make-help.py as topics of blocks of styled spans, which every
 * frontend lays out with its own toolkit.
 *
 * A frontend shows the blocks whose platforms include its own bit. Ids are
 * GitHub's heading slugs ("controllers-and-keys"); a Help button names a
 * context instead ("prefs/Machine", "debugger/cpu"), which stays put when a
 * heading is renamed. Everything here is constant data and reentrant.
